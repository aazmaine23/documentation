We, humans are very complex biological machines with an embedded intelligence system. We have gone so far. We've invented great things. But as we grow, the complexity within us grows too. People just don't realize it. God gave us free will, though we are not free at all. There's nothing called "Absolute Independence", all things are just relative. _("That's a Minkowski Sarcasm")_ We might be the most intelligent species across the entire universe. (Or maybe the least intelligent, who knows?) Although, we are puppets. Not the puppets of God, but of ourselves. Over a long period of time, we have learned so much about our world, we have explored at the deepest of the oceans, we have climbed to the highest point of earth. We didn't stop there. Then we landed on the moon.
